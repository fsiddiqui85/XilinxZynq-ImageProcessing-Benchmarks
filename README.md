# Benchamrking Image Processing Operations

<p align="justify">

This repository contains an implementation of basic image processing operations that are widely used in data intensive video classification and video analytics applications. The code is written in C language and implemented on [Xilinx Zynq 7000 SoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html). This SoC consists of dual Arm Cortex-A9 CPUs tightly coupled with the Xilinx FPGA programmable logic.
